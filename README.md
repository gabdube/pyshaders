PyShaders
===================


Pyshaders aims to completely wraps the opengl2.1 shader api in a python module. Pyshaders provides a pythonic OOP api that hides the lower level (ctypes) calls. Pyshaders provides a high level api and a low level api, and it can be integrated easily with existing code because it does not occlude the underlying opengl values.

PyShaders was programmed using very high standards. This means that Pyshaders is fully tested and it comes with an exhaustive documentation (this file). The code is DRYer than California in 2015 and it makes uses of many advanced python functionalities to make the code smaller, easier to use and easier to read.

**new in 1.1.0!**  

<a name="extensions_overview"></a>

### Overview
By default, pyshaders only wraps the api of opengl 2.1. In order to wrap newer features that might not be supported on older hardware, pyshaders uses **extension modules**. Extensions modules are python modules located in the **pyshaders_extensions** package. These modules **must not be imported using the import keyword**, instead they are loaded using the **load_extension** function. load_extension checks if the client supports the extension and a few other things, if something is wrong **ImportError** or a **PyShadersExtensionError** error is raised.

Extensions modules must not be imported using the **import keyword** because an extension module by itself do nothing: their roles are to register new functionalities inside the pyshaders module.

Lastly, extensions **must be loaded before using the pyshader api**. 

<a name="extensions_usage"></a>

### Usage

Pyshaders offers three top levels functions to manage extensions.

```python
def extension_loaded(extension_name):
def check_extension(extension_name):
def load_extension(extension_name):
```

**extension_name** is any of the extension under [All Extensions](%extensions_all).

**extension_loaded** checks if an extension was loaded. An extension cannot be loaded more than once.  
**check_extension** checks if the client can use the extension  
**load_extension** loads the extension

Example:  
```python
from pyshaders import load_extension, extension_loaded,  check_extension, PyShadersExtensionError
try:
    load_extension('uint_uniforms')
except PyShadersExtensionError:
    print("Your system do not meet the requirements to use this program")
    exit()
    
print(extension_loaded('uint_uniforms'))
# True

print(check_extension('uint_uniforms'))
# True
```

<a name="extensions_all"></a>

Programmer's Guide

<a name="high"></a>

###**High level api**
Unless you are extending an existing code base, the high level api is most likely the api you want to use. 
It handles compiling, uniforms, attributes and freeing.

<a name="compiling"></a>

#### **Compiling shaders**
Pyshaders offers 3 high level functions to load and compile shaders, here are their headers:
```python
def from_string(verts, frags):
def from_files_names(verts, frags):
def from_files(verts, frags):
```
Each of these functions takes the parameters __*verts*__ and __*frags*__. These parameters accept either  a single value or any iterable of vertex sources/fragment sources. 

The returned object is called a ShaderProgram. It is the object that wraps most of the pyshaders features . For more information, see the API section. 

Additionally, if an error happens during compilation, a ShaderCompilationError is raised.  The **logs** property (available on ShaderPrograms, ShaderObjects and ShaderCompilationError ) can be used to access the error details.

Here is a simple shader loading function:
```python
from pyshaders import from_files_names, ShaderCompilationError 
try:
    shader = from_files_names("main.vert", "main.frag")
    shader2 = from_files_names("main.vert", ["main.frag", "lib.frag"])
except ShaderCompilationError as e:
    print(e.logs) 
    exit()

print(shader, shader2, sep=", ")
#ShaderProgram 1, ShaderProgram 2
```


To use or remove a shaderprogram, simply do
```python
shader.use()
# do stuff
ShaderProgram.clear() # or shader.clear()

# or

with shader.using():
    # do stuff
```

**What happens during the compilation?**
- **from_files_names** open the files
- The files contents are loaded into strings
- For every source given, a **ShaderObject** is compiled (see Low Level API)
- The compiled **ShaderObjects** are linked to a **ShaderProgram**
- The uniforms and attributes are cached (see uniforms)
- The  **ShaderProgram** is returned



<a name="uniforms"></a>

#### **Uniforms**

My favorite feature, pyshaders allows seamless uniform writing and reading. After a shader is compiled, all its defined uniforms are accessible via the **uniforms** attribute. Example:

```python
# In the shader source:
# uniform float my_uniform;
# uniform float foo;
shader = from_files_names("main.vert", "main.frag")
shader.use()  #The shader must be in use to set uniforms

print(shader.uniforms)
#["my_uniform", "foo"]

shader.uniforms.my_uniform = 555.0
print(shader.uniforms.my_uniform)
# 555.0
```

No need to declare the *type* or the *name* of the uniforms, pyshaders already knows it! The only "limitation" is that the value are statically typed. For example, assigning an int to a uniform float will raise a **TypeError**.
Also, assigning more values than an array can contains will raise an **IndexError** 

**Transposing matrices**  
By default matrices uniforms are transposed when set. If this behaviour is not desired, the method `transpose_matrices(bool)` can be used to
change the transposition

```python
pyshaders.transpose_matrices(False)
uni.test_mat2 = ((5.0, 8.0), (2.0, 4.0))
assert ((5.0, 2.0), (8.0, 4.0)) == uni.test_mat2
```

**Accessing uniforms properties**
The properties pyshader uses in order to seamlessly get/set uniforms can queried just as easily. The fields are returned by **[glGetActiveUniform](http://docs.gl/gl2/glGetActiveUniform)**.

Example:
```python
uniform = shader.uniforms["my_uniform"]
print(uniform)
# Uniform(loc=c_long(0), type=35675, size=1, name='my_uniform',
# get=<function[...]>, set=<function[...]>)
```
**Special setting behaviour**

**Setting incomplete values**  
Due to ctypes initializing buffers with zeros, setting incomplete values is permitted. The ignored values will be zeroed. Example:

```python
# uniform vec4 unicorn_swag = vec4(6, 6, 6, 6);

print(shader.uniforms.unicorn_swag)
# (6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0)

shader.uniforms.unicorn_swag = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
print(shader.uniforms.unicorn_swag)
# (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0)

shader.uniforms.unicorn_swag = ()
print(shader.uniforms.unicorn_swag)
# (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

shader.uniforms.unicorn_swag = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)
#IndexError
```

By passing an empty tuple, you can quickly clear any array!

**Setting multi level array**  
When setting the value of multi-level arrays (ex: vec4[]), pyshaders flatten the values so the layout does not matter. The "depth" of the array **still** matters. Example:

```python
# uniform vec2[3] blushing_wombat;

#This works, obviously
shader.uniforms.blushing_wombat = ((1.0, 2.0), (3.0, 4.0), (8.0, 11.0))
print(shader.uniforms.blushing_wombat)
# ((1.0, 2.0), (3.0, 4.0), (8.0, 11.0))

# This is also accepted
shader.uniforms.blushing_wombat = ( (5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 1.5), )
print(shader.uniforms.blushing_wombat)
# ((5.0, 3.0), (2.0, 7.0), (1.0, 1.5))

# Not this!
# The underlying code is waiting for an array of array
shader.uniforms.blushing_wombat = (5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 1.5)
```

<a name="attributes"></a>

#### **Attributes**

Shaders attributes can be queried just like the uniforms. Attributes can be used
to get information on attributes arrays.

Shader attribute arrays can be easily enabled and then disabled using the methods *enable* and *disable*.  
The method "point_to" can be used to wrap glVertexAttribPointer.

In order to quickly enable/disable the shader attributes, shader.enable_all_attributes / shader.disable_all_attributes
can be used.

See the api section for more information you can query on attributes.

Example:
```python
# In the shader
# layout(location = 0)in vec3 vertex;
attribute = shader.attributes.vertex

attribute.enable()
attribute.point_to(8, GL_DOUBLE, 3, True, 4)
# Draw something
attribute.disable()
```


<a name="query"></a>

#### **Querying shader informations**

With OpenGL is is possible query information about a shader (information that would be queried with a glGet* call). With pyshaders, it is possible to access these values with python properties. For an exhaustive list of every properties, see the API section. Example:

```python
shader = from_files_names("main.vert", "main.frag")
shader.compiled  # Equivalent to glGetProgram with GL_COMPILE_STATUS
#true
```

<a name="low"></a>
### **Low level api**

The low level api can be used if someone wants full control over the compilation and linking stage.


<a name="lowover"></a>

#### **Overview**

When using the low level api, it's the programmer job to create, compile, link and free the pyshaders objects. The main advantage is that it is possible share ShaderObjects with many ShaderProgram. 

To instance a new ShaderObject, the **vertex** and the **fragment** class methods must be used. The constructor is reserved to wrap existing objects. Setting the shader source is done using the **source** property. Finally, the method**compile** compiles the shader. It will return False if there was an error during the compilation. The **logs** property holds the details of the error.

For ShaderPrograms, the classmethod **new_program** creates a new empty program. Just like the ShaderObjects, the constructor is used to wrap existing objects. ShaderObjects are attached/detached using the **attach**/**detach** methods. Attach and detach take any number of ShaderObjects. Finally, a ShaderProgram can be linked using **link**. Just like the ShaderObjects compile, the method will return False if there was an error. The **logs** property holds the details of the error.

Like raw opengl, ShaderObjects can be attached/detached after the program was linked. Still, linking is an expensive function due to the caching done by pyshaders. Ideally, a shaderprogram should be linked only once.

It is possible to retrieve a shader program objects using the **shaders** method. The returned shaders borrow the gl resource.

Here is the from_string code:
```python
def from_string(verts, frags):
    if isinstance(verts, str): verts = (verts,)
    if isinstance(frags, str): frags = (frags,)
        
    logs, objs = "", []
    
    for src in verts:
        vert = ShaderObject.vertex()
        vert.source = src
        objs.append(vert)
    
    for src in frags:
        frag = ShaderObject.fragment()
        frag.source = src       
        objs.append(frag)
        
    for obj in objs:
        if obj.compile() is False:
            logs += obj.logs
    
    if len(logs) == 0:
        prog = ShaderProgram.new_program()
        prog.attach(*objs)
        if not prog.link():
            raise ShaderCompilationError(prog.logs)
            
        return prog
    
    raise ShaderCompilationError(logs)
```

<a name="owned"></a>

#### **Owned VS Borrowed**

Pyshaders objects wraps underlying globjects. Usually,  pyobjects **own** the underlying data. This means that, when the object is freed (garbage collected), the globjects is marked for deletion (ex: using **glDeleteShader**). Sometimes, a single globject can be shared with multiple pyobjects. In this situation, only one object should have the ownership. The others "borrow" the globject. When an pyobject with a borrowed status is freed,  the underlying globject is not marked for deletion.

The owned/borrowed behavior is detailed on every function where is make sense. 
The property **owned** ShaderObject/ShaderPrograms can be set to change the ownership.

**Freeing ShaderPrograms**
When a program is freed, all the linked shader objects are also marked for destruction. If the program uses a shared shader object, the object must be detached before the object is freed.  **Make sure that *delete* is set to false so that the shader is not freed after being detached.**

Example:
```python
shader.detach(shared_object, delete=False)
```

<a name="integrate"></a>

#### **Integrating with existing code**

It is possible to wrap existing object with pyshader using the ShaderObject and ShaderProgram constructors.
Object wrapped do not own the underlying resources by default. For the object to own the underlying shader, owned=True must be passed to the constructor.

Example:
```python
pid = glCreateProgram()
sid = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER)
shader = ShaderObject(sid)  
program = ShaderProgram(pid, owned=True)
glDeleteShader(sid)
```

Pyshaders also have the **current_program** function that returns the currently bound program in a ShaderProgram.
```python
program = pyshaders.current_program()
print(program is None)
#True

glUseProgram(my_program)
program = pyshaders.current_program()
print(program)
# ShaderProgram 1
```

<a name="future"></a>

**Future**
-------------

I dont think that I will add new features to the main module (pyshaders.py), at least, nothing that will break compatibility. Any feature not supported by OpenGL 2.1 will **never** be added to the main module. For those, extensions will be created. For more informations on extensions see [extensions](#extensions).

Could be added to the main module:

- Support for  other bindings library (ex: PyOpenGL)
- ~~More get for attributes~~ (implemented in 1.2.0)

Could be added as an extension:

- ~~Support for **double, uint ** uniforms~~ (implemented in 1.1.0)
- Support for multi level array ( GL_ARB_arrays_of_arrays ) 
- Uniform structures
- Uniform blocks
- Geometry/Compute shaders
- Subroutines

Will not be added:

- SPIR-V
